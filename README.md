# VIPER 🐍

### by Sebastian Boldt

This is a Xcode Template tailored for my personal taste of the Viper-Architecture

It will create a ViewController, Presenter, Interactor, Router & Wireframe for you.

It uses a protocol-based approach so the components can be tested and mocked easily.

It also creates a DI-Ready Presenter and Interactor for you.

## How to use.

Use the install script that is shipped inside this repository.
