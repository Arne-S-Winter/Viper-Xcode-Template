# VIPER 🐍

### by Sebastian Boldt

This is an Xcode template that reflects my personal taste for the Viper pattern.

I used a protocol-oriented approach so that mocking is possible for all components.

Dependencies are also created for Interactor and Presenter to being able counterfeit the dependencies in the test environment.

## How to use 🛠

Use the install script.

```sudo swift install.swift```
