# VIPER TEMPLATE 🐍

### by Sebastian Boldt

This is an Xcode template that reflects my personal taste for the Viper pattern.

I used a protocol-oriented approach so that mocking is possible for all components.

Protocol based dependencies are also created for Interactor and Presenter so faking them should be easy.

## How to use 🛠

Use the install script.

```sudo swift install.swift```
